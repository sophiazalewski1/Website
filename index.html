            This project implements various parallel graph algorithms to explore 
            the trade-offs between using a higher level, domain specific programming 
            language (such as GraphLab) and a general lower level language (C++ with OpenMP).
            We compare the implementations of:

            Together these algorithms require a wide range of parallel tasks 
            including graph search, contraction, and clustering. We then evaluate 
            the effectiveness of the parallel frameworks using two main metrics: 
            ease of programming and performance. </p>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <h4>1. Max Flow</h4>
            <p>Max Flow is a classic graph optimization problem where the goal is to push some abstract “flow"
            across edges in a directed graph from some source vertex 𝑠 to some sink 𝑡. More concretely, let
            𝐺 = (𝑉 , 𝐸) be a directed graph. Each (𝑢, 𝑣) ∈ 𝐸 has some positive capacity 𝑐 (𝑢, 𝑣) indicating how
            much flow can be pushed from 𝑢 to 𝑣. The goal is to find some flow 𝑓 which can be thought of as a
            function mapping edges to how much flow is being pushed through them. This flow must have the
            following properties:</p>

            $$0 \leq f(u,v) \leq c(u,v) \\
            \sum_u f(u,v) = \sum_u f(u,v) \text{ for all } v \notin \{s,t\}$$

            <p>where the first constraint enforces that no edge has more flow than its capacity and the second
            condition enforces that for all vertices other than 𝑠 and 𝑡. The simplest algorithm for finding max
            flow is called Ford Fulkerson. Ford Fulkerson works by repeatedly finding a path from 𝑠 − 𝑡 that
            increase the overall flow from 𝑠 − 𝑡 and updating some state. The “state" is called the residual graph
            𝐺′ and allows the algorithm to backtrack if necessary. Ford Fulkerson finds “augmenting paths" by
            running a graph search with source 𝑠 and target 𝑡 on the residual graph. Here, we can use a parallel
            implementation of Breadth First Search (BFS). </p>
            
            <p>A more complicated yet efficient algorithm, Dinics,
            finds a set of augmenting paths called a “blocking flow" each iteration by making up to |𝐸| calls to
            depth first search. In Dinics it is therefore possible to add an addition axis of parallelism in finding
            blocking flows. Another extension to the Max Flow problem introduces a cost function to each
            edge that charges a flow $(𝑢, 𝑣) for each unit of flow pushed through (𝑢, 𝑣). The objective becomes
            finding a maximum flow that also minimizes cost. If we have additional time, we will explore these
            extensions to the Ford Fulkerson algorithm [2].</p>

            <h4>3. PageRank (if time)</h4>
            <p>PageRank is a newer graph algorithm designed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin for ranking the
            importance of web pages for their search engine, Google. The algorithm judges the importance
            of a website by estimating the probability that someone randomly clicking links will end up on
            that page. By representing the hyperlinks as a graph where an edge connects page 𝐴 to page 𝐵
            if 𝐴 contains a link to 𝐵, the probability distribution can be calculated iteratively. Each iteration,
            the PageRank value of a vertex is distributed evenly among its outgoing neighbors while at the
            same time its new PageRank value is computed by combining the contributions from its incoming
            neighbors. This process repeats until the graph converges [4]. Because PageRank is defined in
            terms of an update policy for each vertex at every iteration, it is relatively easy to program in
            GraphLab. In a lower level framework like C++ and OpenMP there are a lot more ways to organize
            the computations and the schedule for the updates. One of the goals of our project will be to see if
            we can beat the performance of the GraphLab implementation using this greater flexibility.</p>

            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Graph algorithms contain dependcies between any paths that share an edge</li>
              <li>Very little locality in graph traversal algorithms, each edge in a path
                is in a different cache-line</li>
              <li>Low computation to communication ratio</li>
              <li>Divergent execution since no two runs of a graph traversal traverse the same path</li>
              <li>CMU's Graphlab is deprecated meaning that we need to design our own GraphLab-like
                  language, which we will call GraphLabLite, to test our implementations on this interface

            <h3>Resources</h3>
            <p>For this project, we are using Ford Fulkerson starter code from <a href="https://www.programiz.com/dsa/ford-fulkerson-algorithm" target="blank">programiz</a> 
              and Dinic's starter code from <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dinics-algorithm-maximum-flow/#" target="blank">geeksforgeeks</a>,
              which we will use as our correctness checks for our parallel algorithms.
              After implementing and parallelizing our algorithms, we will be running our implementations
              on the Gates and PSC machines to test our code on a high number of CPUs and measure
              performance and scalability. Additionally, we will also design our own Graph programming lanuage
              (GraphLabLite) and measure the performance of the algorithms in this Graph interface vs. standard OpenMP.

          <div id="Goals and Deliverables", class="link">
            <h3>Goals and Deliverables</h3>
            <h4>1. Plan to Achieve</h4>
            <p>
              We plan to be able to implement at least 2 of the 3 graph algorithms described above in
              OpenMP. Additionally, we also hope to implement our own GraphLab-like interface,
              GraphLabLite, and create versions of each algorithm that can be represetned in this
              interface. We aim to show numerous graphs comparing each of
              our implementations (Ford Fulkerson and Dinics using our various BFS parallziations 
              as well as using our GraphLabLite implementation) across graphs of
              varying types and sizes. For example, we may choose to show the timing of each
              implementation on dense layer graphs of varying number of nodes and varying
              number of layers, or compare the implementation on graphs with the same num-
              ber of nodes but different ”types” / other properties (hence the importance our
              flexible graph generating script). Moreover, we will also produce plots of our
              results scaling with the number of processors.
            </p>
            <h4>2. Hope to Achieve</h4>
            <p>If time allows, we will also implement the PageRank algorithm to have a further metric of comparison
              between GraphLabLite, which we aim to implement, and OpenMP. Furthermore, if we are extra ahead of 
              schedule we will also consider an implementation in MPI, since for very large graphs message passing might be more
              efficient than OpenMP, given that very large graphs may be too large to fit in one memory system.
              If we are struggling to complete all of the implementations on all of the platforms, we will simply
              focus on one algorithm and do a more in-depth analysis on the differences in OpenMP and GraphLabLite
              for that specific algorithm.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="Platform", class="link">
            <h3>Platform Choice</h3>
            <p>We are exploring our own form of GraphLab for one of our implementation platforms because this language is
              specifically designed and optimized for parallelizing graph algorithms. We will compare this to
              OpenMP, since this a shared memory platform, and graph problems will require updating lots
              of shared memory locations. We are mainly considering CPU implementations rather than GPU,
              because graph traversal algorithms are highly divergent and may not benefit from GPUs.
