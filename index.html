            This project implements various parallel graph algorithms to explore 
            the trade-offs between using a higher level, domain specific programming 
            language (GraphLab) and a general lower level language (C++ with OpenMP).
            We compare the implementations of:

            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            Together these algorithms require a wide range of parallel tasks 
            including graph search, contraction, and clustering. We then evaluate 
            the effectiveness of the parallel frameworks using two main metrics: 
            ease of programming and performance. </p>

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
